# Tailwind CSS Purge Configuration Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's purge functionality, specifically in the context of production builds.  Incorrect purge configurations can lead to missing styles, resulting in broken layouts and visual inconsistencies. 

**Bug Description:**
The `purge` option in `tailwind.config.js` is improperly configured, causing Tailwind to remove styles that are actually being used in the application. This typically happens when the purge option does not accurately identify the source files containing the necessary CSS classes.

**Solution:**
The solution involves correctly configuring the `purge` option to include all relevant template files and components where Tailwind classes are used.  This ensures that only unused styles are removed during the build process.
